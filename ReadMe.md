# VBA Challenge: The VBA of Wall Street

## Details About the Challenge
This assignment was designed to challenge me to use [VBA scripting](/multiYear.vbs) to analyze [real stock market data](/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm).

## Stock Market Analyst
1. Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:
   - The ticker symbol
   - Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
   - The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
   - The total stock volume of the stock

2. Use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

## BONUS
- Return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
